                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Back when i was 14, i decided to try creating a simple game
                    to understand how it works, thats how i entered the world of
                    coding and developing. <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In 2021 i started the information systems course at Unifacisa,
                    getting my first job in the field in early 2022 at ITL, since then i
                    worked in development and maintenance of various administrative softwares,
                    using technologies such as Spring, Angular, Cypress and others. <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I like to learn new things and to improve my coding skills, i'm
                    creative and good at team work. Today my main focus is learning new
                    eficient ways to create high performing software, using technologies like
                    Web Assembly with Rust and Next.js with React.
